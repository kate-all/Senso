Do you click your pen, scroll mindlessly through social media, or are addicted to simple mobile games? Then look no further than Senso!

Senso is a simple app that turns any Android device into a fidget tool.
You can rotate, tap, and use the volume keys to move a white ball around the screen. 
These actions are combined with unique phone vibrations to create a satisfying sensory experience which you can enjoy anytime,
anywhere, even when not looking at your phone! For instance, Senso can be used discretely under a table.

Download Senso so you can Fidget to Focus!
